## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Security
- PayPal URL is hardcoded (line 90 of welcome_tab.cpp)
- System ID is hardware-derived (CPU + motherboard + hostname)
- Unlock codes are SHA-256 hashes (cannot be reversed)
- License database is XOR encrypted
- Only admin tool can generate valid unlock codes

### Support Considerations
- Manual license generation (not automated)
- 24-hour turnaround time (set expectations)
- PayPal email used for license delivery
- System ID required for all support requests
- Hardware changes invalidate licenses

### Known Limitations
- No automatic license delivery
- No license transfer between systems
- No refund mechanism (PayPal only)
- Linux-only unlock generator tool
- Manual support email processing
