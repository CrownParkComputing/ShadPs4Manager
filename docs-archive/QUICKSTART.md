‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CUSA12345.pkg
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ CUSA67890.pkg

```

### Install Order

ShadPs4Manager automatically handles install order:
1. Base game must be installed first
2. Updates install on top of base game
3. DLC requires base game + latest update

### Keyboard Shortcuts

- **Ctrl+S** - Open Settings
- **Ctrl+R** - Refresh/Scan
- **Ctrl+Q** - Quit application

### Finding Game Metadata

If IGDB doesn't find your game:
1. Make sure the PKG file has proper metadata
2. Check your IGDB API credentials
3. Try searching by Title ID (e.g., CUSA12345)

## Troubleshooting

### "Permission Denied" Error

**Linux/macOS:**
```bash
chmod +x shadps4-manager-gui
```

### PKG Files Not Showing

1. Check Downloads Folder path in Settings
2. Ensure PKG files are in the correct location
3. Click "Scan Directory" to refresh
4. Check file permissions (must be readable)

### Extraction Fails

1. Check available disk space (need 2x PKG size)
2. Verify extraction path is writable
3. Check Extraction Log for specific errors
4. Try extracting to a different location

### IGDB Not Working

1. Verify your API credentials are correct
2. Check internet connection
3. Ensure credentials haven't expired
4. Get new credentials from [IGDB API](https://api-docs.igdb.com/)

### License Activation Fails

1. Double-check unlock code (case-sensitive)
