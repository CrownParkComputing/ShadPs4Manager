# New Features - October 6, 2025

## 1. Auto-Refresh Library After Extraction

**What Changed:**
- Removed confirmation dialogs after PKG extraction
- Library automatically refreshes when extraction completes
- Cleaner, faster workflow

**Before:**
```
Extract PKG → Progress Dialog → Success Dialog → Confirmation Dialog → Refresh Library → Done Dialog
```

**After:**
```
Extract PKG → Progress Dialog → Auto-Refresh Library → Done!
```

**User Experience:**
- Extract a PKG file
- Progress dialog shows extraction progress
- When complete, dialog closes and library automatically updates
- New game appears immediately in the library
- No extra clicks needed!

## 2. Built-in Archive Extraction (RAR/ZIP/7Z)

**What's New:**
- Downloads folder now recognizes archive files (.rar, .zip, .7z)
- Right-click context menu shows "Extract Archive" option
- Uses system tools (unzip/unrar/7z) for extraction
- Progress dialog shows extraction status

**Supported Formats:**
- `.zip` - Uses `unzip` command
- `.rar` - Uses `unrar` command (falls back to `7z` if unavailable)
- `.7z` - Uses `7z` command

**How to Use:**
1. Place archive files in your Downloads folder
2. Open Downloads tab in ShadPs4Manager
3. Right-click on any archive file
4. Select "Extract Archive"
5. Archive extracts to the same folder
6. Downloads list automatically refreshes

**System Requirements:**
- For ZIP: `unzip` (pre-installed on most Linux systems)
- For RAR: `unrar` or `7z` (`sudo apt install unrar` or `sudo apt install p7zip-full`)
- For 7Z: `7z` (`sudo apt install p7zip-full`)

**Example:**
```bash
# Install required tools (Debian/Ubuntu)
sudo apt install unzip unrar p7zip-full

# Or just the basics
sudo apt install unzip p7zip-full
```

**Features:**
- Progress dialog during extraction
- Error messages if tool is missing
- Automatic refresh after successful extraction
- Handles all common archive formats

## 3. Hardcoded Encrypted IGDB Credentials

**What Changed:**
- IGDB API credentials are now built into the application
- Credentials are encrypted at compile-time using static key
- No need to configure API keys manually
- Users can still override with custom credentials if desired

**Security:**
- Client ID and Secret are XOR-encrypted with SHA256-hashed static key
- Base64-encoded for storage
- Not plaintext in binary
- Machine-specific user settings use dynamic key (hostname + kernel info)

**Default Credentials (Encrypted):**
- Client ID: `ocrjdozwkkal2p4wx9e8qh6lj6kn90`
- Client Secret: `fnyqn5cryif9sww7gxs7xebj3drp3s`

**How It Works:**
1. App checks for user-configured credentials in settings
2. If none found, uses built-in encrypted defaults
3. Decrypts on-the-fly when making API calls
4. Users can still set custom credentials via Settings → IGDB API

**Benefits:**
- Works out of the box - no setup required!
- Game metadata and covers load automatically
- Still respects user customization
- Secure storage using encryption

**Technical Details:**
- Encryption: XOR with SHA256-derived key
- Storage: Base64-encoded strings
- Default key: `"ShadPs4Manager_IGDB_DEFAULT_KEY_v1"` hashed with SHA256
- User settings key: Derived from machine hostname + kernel info

## Testing

### Auto-Refresh:
1. ✅ Extract PKG file through GUI
2. ✅ Progress dialog shows extraction
3. ✅ Dialog closes automatically
4. ✅ Library refreshes without prompts
5. ✅ No crashes

### Archive Extraction:
1. Place test archives in Downloads folder:
   - `test.zip`
   - `game.rar`
