### GUI Application
The ShadPs4Manager GUI provides an intuitive interface for extracting PS4 PKG files:

- Real-time progress tracking
- Current file extraction display
- Extraction speed monitoring
- Detailed logging with timestamps
- Dark theme optimized for extended use

### Progress Tracking

- **Speed Monitoring**: Real-time extraction speed in MB/s
- **Size Tracking**: Total extracted size vs PKG file size
- **Time Tracking**: Elapsed time and estimated completion

## Installation

### Pre-built Binaries
Download the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/jon-crownpark/ShadPs4Manager/releases) page.

### Building from Source

#### Prerequisites
- **CMake** 3.16 or later
- **Qt6** (for GUI application)
- **C++20** compatible compiler
- **Git** (for cloning)

#### Build Instructions

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/jon-crownpark/ShadPs4Manager.git
cd ShadPs4Manager

# Create build directory
mkdir build && cd build

# Configure (with GUI)
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release

# Configure (CLI only, no Qt6 required)
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DBUILD_GUI=OFF

# Build
cmake --build . --config Release

# Optional: Install
cmake --install . --config Release
```

#### Platform-specific Notes

**Linux:**
```bash
# Install Qt6 on Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install qt6-base-dev qt6-tools-dev cmake build-essential

# Install Qt6 on Fedora
sudo dnf install qt6-qtbase-devel qt6-qttools-devel cmake gcc-c++

# Install Qt6 on Arch Linux
sudo pacman -S qt6-base qt6-tools cmake base-devel
```

**Windows:**
- Install Visual Studio 2022 with C++ support
- Install Qt6 from the official installer
- Use CMake GUI or command line with Visual Studio generator

**macOS:**
```bash
# Install dependencies via Homebrew
brew install qt6 cmake ninja
```

## Usage

### GUI Application

1. Launch `shadps4-manager-gui`
2. Click "Select PKG File" to choose your PS4 PKG file
3. Optionally select an output directory (defaults to same location as PKG)
4. Click "Extract PKG" to start extraction
5. Monitor real-time progress with file names and extraction speed

### Command Line Interface

```bash
# Extract to same directory as PKG file
./shadps4-cli /path/to/game.pkg

# Extract to specific directory
./shadps4-cli /path/to/game.pkg /path/to/output/directory

# Show help
./shadps4-cli --help
```

### Example Output

```
=== ShadPS4Manager PKG Extraction ===
PKG File: /home/user/Games/MyGame.pkg
Output Directory: /home/user/Games/MyGame_extracted
PKG Size: 14.2 GB

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"CLI tool not found" error:**
- Ensure the CLI tool is built and accessible
- Check that both GUI and CLI are in the same directory

**Qt6 not found during build:**
- Install Qt6 development packages for your system
- Set Qt6_DIR environment variable if needed
- Use `-DBUILD_GUI=OFF` to build CLI-only version

**Extraction fails:**
- Verify the PKG file is valid and not corrupted
- Ensure sufficient disk space for extraction
- Check write permissions in the output directory
